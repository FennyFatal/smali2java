# Smali2Java
This is an attempt to develop a direct smali to java converter. The goal is for it to be able to decompile a whole framework.jar or any kind of main Android APK without too much trouble into an Eclipse solution.

## Important notes
* THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. It is not complete at all, in fact, it needs YOUR help!. If you're able to fork it and improve it so it can be able to reach its goal, by any means, please do it!
* Please use sample files made with smali 2.0.2 or later, as this project is aimed to use their new syntax, like .param instead of .parameter, and such.

## Compatibility
* You need Visual Studio 2012 and .NET Framework 3.5 installed on your machine.
* It has been reported that it also works with SharpDevelop and Mono, so you can compile it under Linux too!
